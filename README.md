# Porko, the Dice Game

You wake up inside a strange, dice-like room, way up in the sky, with a dice, a button, some screens... and pigs. Lots of pigs. You vaguely recall a children's game you played many years ago. What was it called again? Something porcine, perhaps?

## Instructions

Install like any other Luanti game.

To play, you must reach a score of 100 or more before the AI does, by rolling the die, or passing. If you roll anything but a one, great, you add it to your score, and keep rolling, or pass, if you wish. Otherwise, your score gets reset to where it was last at the start of your turn.
